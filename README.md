# Object Metadata

This repository documents channel types and `raw` types that can be attached user, post, channel, and message objects.

### What's here

The raw and channel-types folders contain a single documentation file in Markdown format for each metadata standard that has been submitted to the repository.

### Adding

* [Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
* In your fork, create a new Markdown file in the appropriate directory with a name matching the "type" for your metadata. _Note: while the pnut.io API does not prevent multiple raw / channel types from declaring the same "type", any **new** entry you submit here should not conflict with an existing entry._
* Commit your changes and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for the new file. All structurally valid entries will be accepted, but we ask that you focus on submitting raw items that are useful candidates for other developers to utilize.

### Modifying

You may modify existing entries, but all pull requests will be approved by pnut.io in consultation with the existing maintainers specified in the current entry. It is advised that you work with the maintainers before requesting a change here.

### Collaborating

Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pnut-api/object-metadata/issues) and the [Developer channel](https://patter.chat/18) to discuss new standards, modifications, and changes to the process.
