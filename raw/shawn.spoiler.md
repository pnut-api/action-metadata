<!-- provide a description of what your raw represents -->
Clients can tell that the post or message contains a [spoiler alert](https://www.wordnik.com/words/spoiler%20alert), and display the topic without displaying the post contents.

Optionally, an `expired_at` timestamp tells the client that after specified date, it is no longer considered a spoiler.

Clients could offer users "Do not hide this topic" for the rest of a session when dismissing a spoiler alert.

<!-- provide at least one example of what your raw might look like in the wild -->
## Example
