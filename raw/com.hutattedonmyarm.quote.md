<!-- provide a description of what your raw item represents -->
This is for embedding quotes into posts. Clients can use this info to highlight embedded quotes.
This leans onto the [Entities](https://pnut.io/docs/api/implementation/entities) field of posts. 
The quote and itself is part of the posttext, and the raw contains additional info. 

It is required to set a display text of the source of the quote in `source_text`. If the name of the source is already present in the post text its position may be set with `source_pos` and `source_len`, so clients can visually highlight it if theey want.
The same applies to the quote text itself. Its position within the post text can be specified with `pos` and `len` to allow clients to visually distinguish it. To accomodate to the fact, that a quote may be split into two parts `pos` and `len` are arrays.

Optionally the creation date of the quote can be specified in `source_created_at`.

`source_url` optionally contains a link with further info (e.g. a pnut post, a wiki page, etc)

Position and lengths are all multibyte (UTF-32) code points (just like entities).
If quotation marks are present, they should be counted as parts of the quote.
