> ### io.pnut.core.crosspost

<!-- provide a description of what your raw represents -->
The crosspost raw is meant to specify the original or canonical source of a post on pnut.io from somewhere else on the web.

Optional fields can clarify the originating service, if there is a relevant external service to link to, and the originating user from the external service. If referenced, clients can handle the crosspost raw similar to if the post or message were a "repost", where the client would display the user and service, and note the actual Pnut user that is crossposting it.

<!-- provide at least one example of what your raw might look like in the wild -->
## Example

~~~ json
{
    "io.pnut.core.crosspost": [
        {
            "canonical_url": "https://twitter.com/pnutio/status/875679848903192576",
            "source": {
                "name": "Twitter",
                "url": "https://twitter.com"
            },
            "user": {

                "username": "pnutio"
